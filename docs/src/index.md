# Berth Documentation

Berth is a CLI tool and runtime for managing MCP servers with predictable install,
configuration, lifecycle, and security workflows.

This docs site is the published reference skeleton for the current implementation.
It will expand as the roadmap moves into later phases.

Current implemented areas:

- registry search and server metadata inspection
- install/uninstall/update/config workflows
- runtime lifecycle and status/logs
- permissions, audit, and proxy execution
- client linking for Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and Continue

Use the sections in the left navigation to drill into command usage and behavior.
